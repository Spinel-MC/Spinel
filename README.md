Spinel is a Rust framework for building high-performance, custom Minecraft servers. It's designed to aim for as much developer freedom as possible.

## Key Features

- **Module System:** Due to the nature of this project, having the choice to implement certain modules from dependencies is necessary.

- **Event System:** Spinel has an easy to use event system, that allows developers to use and create their own custom events.

- **Networking System:** Like the event system, Spinel also has a packet listener and sender, which can be used both in modules, and in your own server.


## Early Development

Spinel is in it's infancy, so many things aren't complete. Through open contributions, we are able to further develop Spinel into what it's supposed to be.
